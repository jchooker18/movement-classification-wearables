# Movement Classification with Wearable Devices
Wearable motion tracking devices generate huge amounts of data to enable health-conscious people (or tech enthusiasts) to monitor their activity, thus allowing them to find patterns in their behavior that may help them improve their health. People often quantify how much of an activity they do, but rarer is quantifying the quality of that activity - the latter is the goal of this project. The data was collected from six participants who wore accelerometers on their belts, forearms, upper arms, and dumbbells and performed lifts correctly and in five different incorrect ways. The random forest model created is used to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise.
